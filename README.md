Source Code for Pfeiffer, Kapla and Bura (2020). "Least Squares and Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Sufficient Reductions in Regressions with Matrix Valued Predictors"

# Quick Overview
- The directory "tensor_predictors" contains the functions that implement the different methods in the paper
- The directory "eeg_analysis" contains the code for the analysis of the EEG data in the paper.
- The directory "examples" contains examples for using the functions in the directory tensor_predictors that implement the different methods in the paper.
- The directory "simulations" contains the data generation code and the simulation code for the results presented in the paper.

# Note
This is *not* the active development version. This repository contains the exact code used for the simulations in Pfeiffer, Kapla and Bura (2020).
